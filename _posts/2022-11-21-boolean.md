# Lesson Overview: 3.5 - Boolean Expressions
- Here we will focus on:
    - relational operators and variable/expression/number relationships
    - logical operators
    - applications of True/False expressions

## Must Knows
- A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE
- The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below.

- A few ways these operators could be used...

## Determing if a number is Even or Odd:
- The MOD operator can determine whether or not a number is even, because it checks what the remainder would be if said number is divided by 2

- Here, the operator checks what the remainder would be if "num" is divided by 2, and since it is 0, "num" must be an even number

## Try this!
- How could you use operators to determine if the average of grade1, grade2, and grade3 is at least a 70?
