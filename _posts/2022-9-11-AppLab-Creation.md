### What Went Well:
- I utilized two separate themes for each respective quiz. For my soccer quiz, I employed the Blue Steel theme, which was offered by Code.Org and was very visually appealing and aesthetic. I also utilized the Cucumber theme for the Stress Assessment, in order to establish a much lighter, friendlier tone with my user.
- The functions work well, and for the soccer quiz, a score and message is displayed at the end. 

### Setbacks:
- I had difficulty storing the score to the soccer quiz properly, as the score remained 3/3 no matter what. After a bit of trouble shooting, I eventually set the initial variable equal to 3, and for every wrong answer chosen, the score would negate by 1. 
- I feel that, despite my goal of wanting my interface to require as little work as possible, for the user to restart the creation, he or she must restart the entire program. This is because I have not integrated a working "home" button yet.
