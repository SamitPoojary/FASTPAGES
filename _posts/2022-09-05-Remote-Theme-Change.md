title: Changing the Default Remote Theme!
---

For kicks, I decided to change the deafult minima theme to a different variant - just to see the possible drawbacks of doing so. 

After finding it online, I was able to change the entire theme of my FastPages site to darkmode, which was done by importing it into custom-styles.scss section of my minima section.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/darkmode2.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")




Once the changes had been committed, here were the results:

As shown above, the darkmode theme makes my blog site look really cool! The black contrasts super well with my title image of Kobe Bryant, and I was really looking forward to keeping the theme... 

Unfortunately, the darkmode had some strange effects on my coding syntax, and even prohibited my ability to access my Tags page! I was extremely upset that this awesome theme took so much away from the backbone of my blog site, but it's all part of the process. 

I was soon able to figure out that the darkmode theme which I had found online wasn't compatible with the corresponding CSS of my FastPages site, so I searched up one that WAS compatible, and now it works! However, I may continue to change the color theme of my blog site from time-to-time.
