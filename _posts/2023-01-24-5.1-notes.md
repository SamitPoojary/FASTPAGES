# Big Idea 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects - Reflection

The Pros and Cons of Computer Science:

Increased Productivity and Efficiency: Computer Science has transformed our daily lives and work routines by providing more advanced tools for communication, data processing, and problem solving. However, it has also led to job automation and decreased employment opportunities.

Improved Education and Access to Information: With the advent of the internet and computer technology, people have greater access to educational resources and information. However, this has also contributed to the spread of false information and a decrease in focus and attention spans due to increased distractions.

### Dopamine and its Problems
With the advancement of technology, people, particularly teenagers, have become increasingly desensitized to dopamine, leading to the rise of dopamine detox lifestyles. Social media, in particular, provides users with a constant stream of dopamine through the simple act of scrolling through 15-second videos. This has contributed to the decline in attention span, with people now only having an attention span of less than 10 seconds. Content creators have adapted their products to cater to these short attention spans, resulting in a continuous boost of dopamine. However, this constant stimulation has caused a desensitization of dopamine among teens, leading to increased rates of depression and anxiety among Gen Z kids. The writer admits to spending an excessive amount of time on social media, despite not having a negative impact on their academics and social life. Despite this, they believe it is important to consider reducing their cell phone usage to avoid desensitization to dopamine.

The Steps to Digital Empowerment:

Improve digital literacy: Acquire the skills necessary to use technology effectively and safely, including knowledge of online privacy and security.
Establish a strong online presence: Build a personal brand and create a professional profile on social media platforms.
Secure personal information: Protect passwords, limit the information shared online, and stay alert for potential scams.
Stay informed: Keep up with the latest technology trends and advancements to make informed decisions.
Network and collaborate: Connect with like-minded individuals and build a professional network.
Continuously learn and adapt: Stay curious and open to learning new skills and technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving digital world.
The writer, who considers themselves digitally empowered, offers ways to help others who are not empowered, such as demonstrating how to do something, giving tips and tricks, and helping set up technology and tools.

Paper-based systems and bureaucratic processes can act as barriers to digital empowerment. By digitizing information and processes, organizations and governments can reduce the burden of paperwork, making it easier for individuals to access information and services, which can promote digital empowerment. However, in some cases, limitations such as restricted access to websites on school networks can hinder digital empowerment, as the writer has experienced while in school. Despite the need for security, restrictions on access to necessary resources can impede learning and growth.
