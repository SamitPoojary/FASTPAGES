 In this code segment, if timer is greater than 60, bonus is assigned 1500 in the first IF block. If timer is between 30 and 60, inclusive, bonus is assigned 1000 in the second IF block. If timer is less than 30, bonus is assigned 500 in the third IF block. The correct number of bonus points is assigned to bonus for all possible values of timer.
