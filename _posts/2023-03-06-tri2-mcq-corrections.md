The correct answer here is B and D, because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. And since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.
