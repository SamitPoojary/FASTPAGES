As you can see, I scored a 46/50 on the Tri 2 Final MCQ (92%)

# Reviewing Questions that I missed:

## Q2:

Here, choice A is the correct answer choice because the aggregation of information in browser cookies can be used by websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user.

## Q 33:

Here, choice B is the correct answer choice because the loop that repeats four times returns the robot to its starting position. The three lines of code that follow the loop move the robot one row up and leave it facing right. When this has been repeated twice, the robot is in the gray square.

## Q 34:

Here, option D is actually the correct answer choice because the robot moves forward three spaces, turns to the left, moves forward two spaces, turns to the right, and moves forward three spaces.

## Q 50:

For this question, I had completely misinterpreted the question and selected options B and C, but the correct choices are actually A and D. 

A is correct because As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at a linear rate, as the number of steps is equal to 10n for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time.

D is correct because the number of steps for this algorithm is equal to the length of the list squared, as the number of steps is equal to n^2 for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time.
