# Corrections and Reflection

Question 27:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2_midterm_2.png)

I had chosen option C.
> This algorithm is wrong, however. This is because the function get messed up since the n = n+1 is set at the beginning, therefore, the "repeat n times" function will mess the code up from the beginning. 

> Therefore, option D is correct because it sets the n = n+1 at the end of the algorithm. 

Question 28:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2_midterm_3.png)

> Here I had chosen the correct options in A and C, but I must have been rushing, as I had also chosen option B. This resulted in me choosing 3 different options even though the instructions clearly intructed for just 2 to be selected. 

Question 30:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2_midterm_4.png)

> Here I had chosen option C, which is correct, but I had chosen option A instead of B. B is the correct algorithm out of the two, however, because the "drawCircle" command comes after setting the new r and y values.
