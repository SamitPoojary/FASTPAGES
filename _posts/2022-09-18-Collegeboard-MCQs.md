### After watching the Jaeson Han Videos, here is what I was able to take away...

- Computing innovations are improved through collaboration
- Effective collaboration is able to produce computing innovations that reflect the diversity of skillful talents and varying perspectives of those who designed it.
- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function
- Computing innovations can be physical (such as a self-driving car), or nonphysical, such as softwares or concepts (picture editing software, e-commerce, etc.)
- Communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation are all interpersonal skills leraned through collaboration. 
- Don't be a backseat programmer! It is important to note the difference between back-seat programming and navigating. 
- Let the driver work through things, but help them out whenever they require assistance! Everyone makes mistakes, so it's understandable.
- Basic formula for collaborating in class: Think-Pair-Share
    - Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class. 
- It's essential that your coding partners leave comments in code. It helps communicate what your code does to your partner, and it comunicates to yourself what the code does (in case you forget)


#### After completing the collaboration MCQ's... 

- I believe that my Scrum Team is best equipped for the skill sets we need in order to find success in this course.
- Although we are constructed based off of close friend relationships, we work extremely well together, constantly learning from one another and progressing forward as a collective group.
- Our group in particular is diverse in terms of ethnic background and perspectives, but not gender. I feel that we will still be successful as a team, as long as we stay true to working together.
