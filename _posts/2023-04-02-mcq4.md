As you can see, I scored a 46/50 on the MCQ 4 Revisions (92%)

# Reviewing Questions that I missed:

Option B is correct because Statement I is false because computers A and D can communicate with each other through one computer, E. Statement II is true because there is a direct link between computers B and C.

Option C is correct here because using 6-bit binary sequences allows for 26 or 64 different items to be identified. Using 7-bit binary sequences allows for 27 or 128 different items to be identified. Thus there are two times as many items that can be uniquely identified.

Option D is correct because in the second iteration of the loop, i is equal to 2. Thus RANDOM(1, i) returns either 1 or 2. So, the output 1 3 2 4 is not possible.

Option A is correct here because this code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a studentâ€™s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped.
