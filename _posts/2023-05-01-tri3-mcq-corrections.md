Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
