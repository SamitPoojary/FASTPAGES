## Possible Ideas for Performance Task
- Previous year of the English Premier League (EPL) achievements and notable record database from which information can be obtained (all of this using real-time data).
    - The EPL is a professional soccer league located in England, and a database such as the hypothetical one mentioned above will allow unknowing people of what the league is, and a basic idea of what has been occurring over the last year in the league.
- A college acceptance calculator that weighs a student's accolades and grade achievements, then determine's the percent chance of that student being admitted to the college. 
    - A tool like this will greatly allow students to choose a college that best suits them for their own interests, as well as for their accolades throughout high school. 

## Managing Complexity and Abstracting Data:
 
Obviously, I still need to improve and learn more about managing the complexity of my projects. If I were to create an app such as the ones listed above, in which I accumulate data and store them into a databse from which they can then be extracted from, I will need to master the use of functions and variables in order to utilize "the lazy programmer way", and not do everything manually. Additionally, the algorithm needs to be RUNNING, in order to ensure obtained points on the Create Task. 

## Resources

After interpreting Bria's post review, I took note of the most important takeaways I believe to have the most impact in terms of efficient preparation. 

One of these resources include Khan Academy, which Bria stated was a vital factor that played a strong role in her journey to obtaining a 5 on the AP Exam. Another thing she stressed was reviewing the past scoring examples from CollegeBoard, who allowed Bria to guide her performance task with ease, ultimately allowing her to obtain the maximum amount of points on her project.
