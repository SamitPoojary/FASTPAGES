# Write-Up (Air Quality Analyzer)

## 3a. 

### 3.a.i.

This program is designed to inform citizens, and potential travelers, about the air pollution levels in any given city to provide them with sufficient intel on whether or not they need to be cautious of air quality. 

### 3.a.ii.

This program uses the requests module to connect to a public API that provides information about air quality in cities. It allows the user to input a city and retrieve data on either PM2.5 or PM10 concentrations. The user can also view a list of previously retrieved concentrations. The program uses a dictionary called 'data' to store the concentration values that have been retrieved. The dictionary has two keys, 'pm25' and 'pm10', each of which contains a dictionary of city names and concentration values. When the user selects option 1 or 2, the program sends a request to the API and retrieves the concentration data for the specified city. If the data is available, the program outputs the concentration and a safety message based on the value of the concentration. It then adds the city and concentration to the 'data' dictionary. When the user selects option 3, the program outputs a list of the city names and their respective PM2.5 and PM10 concentration values that have been stored in the 'data' dictionary. The program uses a while loop to keep running until the user selects option 4 to exit the program.

### 3.a.iii.

This program is designed to test a user's reaction time by presenting them with circular targets on the screen. The user must click on each target, after which the target will be resized and relocated to a new random position in the game container. The objective is to score as many points as possible within a 15-second time limit. The user must pay 15 tokens to play, and their score will determine the number of tokens they earn. The program displays real-time updates of the user's token balance and overall game performance. This project demonstrates the use of a currency system and how it can be integrated into a game-like application.
