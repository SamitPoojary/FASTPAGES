# Write-Up (Air Quality Analyzer)

## 3a. 

### 3.a.i.

This program is designed to inform citizens, and potential travelers, about the air pollution levels in any given city to provide them with sufficient intel on whether or not they need to be cautious of air quality. 

### 3.a.ii.

This program uses the requests module to connect to a public API that provides information about air quality in cities. It allows the user to input a city and retrieve data on either PM2.5 or PM10 concentrations. The user can also view a list of previously retrieved concentrations. The program uses a dictionary called 'data' to store the concentration values that have been retrieved. The dictionary has two keys, 'pm25' and 'pm10', each of which contains a dictionary of city names and concentration values. When the user selects option 1 or 2, the program sends a request to the API and retrieves the concentration data for the specified city. If the data is available, the program outputs the concentration and a safety message based on the value of the concentration. It then adds the city and concentration to the 'data' dictionary. When the user selects option 3, the program outputs a list of the city names and their respective PM2.5 and PM10 concentration values that have been stored in the 'data' dictionary. The program uses a while loop to keep running until the user selects option 4 to exit the program.

### 3.a.iii.

This program is designed to test a user's reaction time by presenting them with circular targets on the screen. The user must click on each target, after which the target will be resized and relocated to a new random position in the game container. The objective is to score as many points as possible within a 15-second time limit. The user must pay 15 tokens to play, and their score will determine the number of tokens they earn. The program displays real-time updates of the user's token balance and overall game performance. This project demonstrates the use of a currency system and how it can be integrated into a game-like application.

### 3.b.iii.

The name of the variable representing the collection type is "pm25", which is a dictionary consisting of the stored concentration values of pm25 in the inputted cities by the user. 

### 3.b.iv.

The second image represents the usage of the code, and as mentioned previously, the collection type "pm25" serves as a dictionary to not only output the respective concentration value of the city, but also store the user's inputs if the option 3 is selected from the menu. Essentially, it serves as a collection type, specifically a dictionary. It is being used to store the PM2.5 concentrations for different cities. Each key in the pm25 dictionary represents a city and its value is the corresponding PM2.5 concentration.

### 3.b.v.

The data dictionary is used to store the collected PM2.5 concentration data with the key pm25 pointing to a sub-dictionary that stores data for different cities. Storing the PM2.5 concentration data in a collection type allows the program to easily access and manipulate the data. By using a dictionary to store the data, the program can quickly look up PM2.5 concentration data for a specific city by accessing the corresponding key in the data dictionary. The importance of pm25 as a collection type is that it allows the program to store and retrieve PM2.5 concentration data for various cities over multiple runs of the program. By storing the data in a collection type, the program can access the previously collected data when the user requests PM2.5 concentration data for a city that has already been searched. This avoids making unnecessary API requests and saves time and resources.

### 3.c.iii.

The procedures here are "find_pm25" and "find_pm10". As the names imply, these functions are able to return a numerical integer that represents the pm25 or pm10 concentration, respectively, of any given city in the United States. It is called in the while loop, as it is required for achieving the objective of the menu of options. If either choice is selected, the terminal will prompt the user to enter a city name, and will then return the respective concentrations. 

### 3.c.iv.

Here, sequencing, selection, and iteration are used to provide a user-friendly interface for finding air quality information for different cities. The code uses sequencing to display a menu of options for the user to choose from. The menu includes the following options: finding the PM2.5 concentration for a city, finding the PM10 concentration for a city, viewing the stored values for PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations for cities, and exiting the program. Selection is used to determine which action the user wants to perform based on the choice they make. If the user chooses option 1, they will be prompted to enter a city, and the function find_pm25 will be called to retrieve and display the PM2.5 concentration for that city. If the user chooses option 2, they will be prompted to enter a city, and the function find_pm10 will be called to retrieve and display the PM10 concentration for that city. If the user chooses option 3, the stored PM2.5 and PM10 values for each city will be displayed using iteration. Finally, if the user chooses option 4, the program will exit.
