# Write-Up (Air Quality Analyzer)

## 3a. 

### 3.a.i.

This program is designed to inform citizens, and potential travelers, about the air pollution levels in any given city to provide them with sufficient intel on whether or not they need to be cautious of air quality. 

### 3.a.ii.

This program uses the requests module to connect to a public API that provides information about air quality in cities. It allows the user to input a city and retrieve data on either PM2.5 or PM10 concentrations. The user can also view a list of previously retrieved concentrations. The program uses a dictionary called 'data' to store the concentration values that have been retrieved. The dictionary has two keys, 'pm25' and 'pm10', each of which contains a dictionary of city names and concentration values. When the user selects option 1 or 2, the program sends a request to the API and retrieves the concentration data for the specified city. If the data is available, the program outputs the concentration and a safety message based on the value of the concentration. It then adds the city and concentration to the 'data' dictionary. When the user selects option 3, the program outputs a list of the city names and their respective PM2.5 and PM10 concentration values that have been stored in the 'data' dictionary. The program uses a while loop to keep running until the user selects option 4 to exit the program.

### 3.a.iii.

This program is designed to retrieve air quality data for cities around the world. It does so by making requests to an API and storing the data in a dictionary called "data". The program provides users with a menu of options to select from, including the ability to retrieve PM2.5 or PM10 concentrations for a specific city, view all results, or see a list of cities that have been searched. The goal of the program is to help users make informed decisions about air quality and take appropriate precautions if necessary.

### 3.b.iii.

The variable representing the list used in this program is city_list. This list is used to store the names of cities for which PM2.5 or PM10 concentration data has been collected.

### 3.b.iv.

The second image represents the usage of the code, and is executed when the user chooses option 4 in the main while loop. It loops over the city_list list and prints out each city name after stripping off any concentration data that may have been accidentally added to the name. This list purely represented the names of the cities which the user has already inputted into the machine so far, so that they may keep track of the cities whose air qualities they have already judged. 

### 3.b.v.

The named list in the code, represented by the variable city_list, is used to manage the complexity of the program by keeping track of the cities that the user has searched for. Without this list, it would be difficult to keep track of the cities that have already been searched and to display them when the user chooses to view the list. If the program did not use this list, the user would have to remember the cities they have searched for or write them down manually, which would be inconvenient and could lead to errors. Additionally, if the program did not use a list, it would be more difficult to scale the program to include additional functionality or data sources because the city search functionality would be tightly coupled to the code that displays the search history.

### 3.c.ii.

### 3.c.iii.

The procedure here is "find_pm25" and in this procedure, city is a parameter that determines which city's PM2.5 data is retrieved and displayed. If city were not passed as a parameter, the procedure would not know which city's data to retrieve and would not be able to display the correct information. This functionality allows the user to input a city and obtain information on its PM2.5 concentration level. The stored concentration data can be later used to generate a report of all the cities and their respective PM2.5 concentration levels. The city_list allows the user to keep track of the cities they have searched for, which can be useful for future reference. Essentially, these procedures contribute to the program's functionality by providing an interactive way to obtain and store air quality data for cities.

### 3.c.iv.

The while loop in the given code utilizes sequencing, selection, and iteration to create a simple interactive program. The loop starts by displaying the user's options, where the user can input a choice from 1 to 5. The selection process then checks the user's input, and if the input is valid, the program executes the corresponding block of code. This process of selection and sequencing is repeated until the user chooses to exit, which occurs when they input the number 5. The iteration occurs through the loop's repeated execution, as it iterates through the user's input and corresponding actions. Within each of the selection blocks, additional sequencing occurs through the execution of multiple lines of code. For example, within the "Find PM2.5 concentration for a city" block, the sequence of events is as follows: the user inputs a city name, the code calls the "find_pm25" function, the function makes an API call and processes the data, and then the program prints out the resulting concentration level and safety information.

## 3.d

### 3.d.i.

#### Call One

The first call is in the function "find_pm25" which will find and return the PM2.5 concentration for the city. This will execute the segment of code inside the find_pm25 procedure where a GET request is sent to the API to retrieve the PM2.5 concentration data for a city. If the data is available, the concentration level will be printed along with a message indicating whether the air quality is safe or not. The concentration value will then be added to the data dictionary and the city will be added to the city_list list.

#### Call Two

The second call is in the function "find_pm10" which will find and return the PM10 concentration for the city. This will execute the segment of code inside the find_pm10 procedure where a GET request is sent to the API to retrieve the PM10 concentration data for city. If the data is available, the concentration level will be printed along with a message indicating whether the air quality is safe or not. The concentration value will then be added to the data dictionary and the city will be added to the city_list list.
### 3.d.ii.

#### Condition(s) tested by Call One

Here, the condition being tested is whether there is any data available for the PM2.5 concentration in the given city. If the data is available, the code segment that prints the PM2.5 concentration for the city is executed, followed by a nested selection statement that checks whether the PM2.5 concentration is less than 25. If the concentration is less than 25, the message "This is a safe level of air quality. Enjoy!" is printed. Otherwise, the message "This is unsafe air quality. Be cautious!" is printed. The PM2.5 concentration value is then stored in the data dictionary. If the data is not available for the given city, the message "Sorry, there is no PM2.5 data available for {city}." is printed.

#### Condition(s) tested by Call Two

The second call to the find_pm10 procedure is testing whether the concentration of PM10 in a given city is less than 25. If the concentration is less than 25, the code will print "This is a safe level of air quality. Enjoy!". Otherwise, it will print "This is unsafe air quality. Be cautious!".

### 3.d.iii.

#### Results of Call One

The result of call one depends on the input argument city. If the API response for PM2.5 data contains a valid concentration value for the specified city, then the function will print the PM2.5 concentration value and a message indicating whether the air quality is safe or not, based on the concentration level. The PM2.5 concentration value will also be stored in the data dictionary. If the API response does not contain any PM2.5 data for the specified city, the function will print a message saying so. If an error occurs while processing the request, the function will print an error message.

#### Results of Call Two

Here, the condition being tested is the presence of PM10 concentration data for the city passed as an argument. If the data is present, the PM10 concentration value is retrieved and compared to the safe level threshold of 25. If the concentration is below 25, a message indicating safe air quality is printed, and the value is stored in the data dictionary. Otherwise, a message indicating unsafe air quality is printed. If the concentration is below 25, the value would be stored in the data dictionary under the pm10 key for the specified city. If PM10 concentration data is not present, the function would print a message indicating the absence of data for the specified city.
