## Brainstorming Quiz Ideas
- Basketball Quiz
- Soccer Quiz
- Stress Relief Quiz
- Stress Assessment Quiz

Taking these ideas into mind, I ended up choosing two of these four to elaborate upon - the Soccer Quiz and the Stress Assessment Quiz.

## Outline
- Create all components of interface first (screens, buttons, images, etc.)
- Using the coding blocks, weave together a block of code that will enable the user to fluidly progress throughout the interface.
- Establish two different pathways - one for the soccer quiz, the other for the stress assessment quiz. 

## Objectives
- I want to develop a sturdy, fluid project that will not require too much work in order to create, primarily by utiliizng onEvent and setScreen functions. 
- I want to create two separate, yet short quizzes that assess one knowledge of soccer players, as well as one's stress levels - from which I will advise them how to deal with those situations.
