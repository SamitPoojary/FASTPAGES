# Personal Goals for Computer Science this Year!

## Testing Markdown

Hello! This is a sample markdown post. I would like to briefly describe my goals for the upcoming school year, specifically in this class, APCSP. I would like to develop a great understanding of python, so that I can apply its concepts into universal issues in an attempt to resolve them. I would also like to better familiarize myself with VS Code and Github, as I understand how vital they are to my success in this class!
