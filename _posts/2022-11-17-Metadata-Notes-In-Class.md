- Front matter is an example OF metadata
    - "data about the data"
    - this data isn't specifically in the post, it's about the post
    - "Samit" is not inside me, but it describes me and gives data about me
- Liquid code is code that exists in the programming location, but transforms/converts when produced in browser
    - essentially a placeholder
    - allows us to display data in a template
    - liquid files are a mixture of HTML and Liquid code
