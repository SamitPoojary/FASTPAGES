# Our Project!
- While showcasing our project to the rest of the CSP and CSA students (along with some curious parents!), we had many positive reactions and feedback
- Many students found it interesting
- Even more greatly appreciated the ability to choose an interface with their preferred language
- Here's our project on display:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/n@tm.jpg "Reem testing out the algorithm!")
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gr1.png "CodeHoots")
- Above is the CodeHoots project, which is a project that rivals Kahoot.
- Each question prompted the user with a timer and a skip question button, and the frontend was layed out perfectly
- Probably my favorite project out of the whole CS group
- Very well made and usable
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gr2.png "Casino")
- Above is a Casino-based project, which consists of multiple video games and interactions
- I personally enjoyed their blackjack game, but the other games were also fun
- I thought it was super impressive that they had a co-op version for Pong
