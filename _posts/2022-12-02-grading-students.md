| Name | Conditional Completion | Boolean Completion | Notes | Final Score |
|:----:|:----------------------:|:------------------:|:-----:|:-----------:|
|Dhruva| 0.45| 0.45| This person shows an understanding of the loops but doesn’t correctly utilize booleans for the expired aspect. This means the conditional is invalid and doesn’t work at all conditions. Boolean hacks are completed per request and meet all standards| 0.9/1|
|Tirth|0.5|0.5|Exceeds all the requirements of the conditionals. Very unique way of approaching it with a lot of extra code that wasn’t taught in the lesson. | 1/1|
|Mani| 0.4|0.5|Exemplifies understanding of nested conditionals. Doesn’t utilize a boolean regarding expiration requirement. Boolean hacks are thorough and show great understanding of keys and values|0.9/1|
|Ekam|0.45|0.5|The loop does work well and meets the expectations, the only thing that the person is missing is the boolean regarding expiration rather than using integers. Boolean hacks are exceptional and go above standards|0.95/1|
|Sreeja|0.45|0.45|This meets the expectations. All the required aspects are met and are done correctly to meet all the conditions. However, there's nothing that stands out. Boolean hacks are thorough and show a good understanding of keys and values.|0.9/1|
