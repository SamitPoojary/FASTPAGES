<h2 id="brainstorming-quiz-ideas">Brainstorming Quiz Ideas</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Basketball Quiz</li>
  <li>Soccer Quiz</li>
  <li>Stress Relief Quiz</li>
  <li>Stress Assessment Quiz</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these ideas into mind, I ended up choosing two of these four to elaborate upon - the Soccer Quiz and the Stress Assessment Quiz.</p>

<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create all components of interface first (screens, buttons, images, etc.)</li>
  <li>Using the coding blocks, weave together a block of code that will enable the user to fluidly progress throughout the interface.</li>
  <li>Establish two different pathways - one for the soccer quiz, the other for the stress assessment quiz.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I want to develop a sturdy, fluid project that will not require too much work in order to create, primarily by utiliizng onEvent and setScreen functions.</li>
  <li>I want to create two separate, yet short quizzes that assess one knowledge of soccer players, as well as one’s stress levels - from which I will advise them how to deal with those situations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-went-well">What Went Well:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I utilized two separate themes for each respective quiz. For my soccer quiz, I employed the Blue Steel theme, which was offered by Code.Org and was very visually appealing and aesthetic. I also utilized the Cucumber theme for the Stress Assessment, in order to establish a much lighter, friendlier tone with my user.</li>
  <li>The functions work well, and for the soccer quiz, a score and message is displayed at the end.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setbacks">Setbacks:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I had difficulty storing the score to the soccer quiz properly, as the score remained 3/3 no matter what. After a bit of trouble shooting, I eventually set the initial variable equal to 3, and for every wrong answer chosen, the score would negate by 1.</li>
  <li>I feel that, despite my goal of wanting my interface to require as little work as possible, for the user to restart the creation, he or she must restart the entire program. This is because I have not integrated a working “home” button yet.</li>
</ul>
