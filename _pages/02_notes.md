## Week 0
- Tool Setup
- PowerShell
    - cd = change directory
    - code . = open VSCode via terminal
    - ls = list files
- Markdown (md)
    - #, ##, ### = types of font (Heading, Subheading, etc.)
    - Use hyphens to create a bullet point

## Week 1
- Intro to Python
    - print () = displays whatever is in quotations
    - def = defines a function which can then be used in the future


## VSCode Terminology:
- Source Control: This is the tab in VSCode where you stage, commit, and sync changes.
- Debug Console: This is where you can debug and work around any issues in your VSCode files.


## Largest Takeaway of Trimester 1:
- **Need to be more proactive on fastpages, and more consistent with commits and additions**
- Collaboration was on point this trimester, should be carrying it over into Tri 2
- **Rather than being a weekend worker, should be working more consistently throughout the week and accomplish more so that I have more time for other tasks**
- Flask site was solid, more could have been done to it and more consistent commits
- **My role during the Final project definitely could've been played out better, and as the Frontend devloper, once my duties have been complete, I should be helping out the Backend developer with their duties**
- Quality of the work was solid, but obviously room for improvement
- **should be more proactive about extra credit opportunities as well so as to stay ahead of the curve, and complete as much cs work as possible - this will allow me to better familiarize myself with cs components**
- More familiarized with JavaScript now, keep refining those skills to carry over into Tri 2
- **Should work to better understand components of JSON and its various applications**
- More familiarized with Python, and HTML... should continue to see rapid improvement come Tri 2
