    "# Databases and SQlite\n",
    "SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is embedded within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite a great choice for small-scale applications or for use in situations where you don't want to set up a full database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using SQLite include its simplicity, small footprint, and portability. Because SQLite is embedded in an application, you don't need to worry about setting up a separate database server or dealing with complicated configuration files. SQLite is also very lightweight, with a small memory footprint, making it ideal for use in small-scale applications or situations where resources are limited. In addition, SQLite databases are stored as a single file, which means they can easily be moved between different systems or shared with other users. This makes SQLite a great choice for developers who need to distribute their applications or work on multiple platforms.\n",

    "In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, a popular Python web framework. Flask provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with SQLite databases, and we'll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We'll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a good understanding of how to work with SQLite databases in Flask and be ready to start building your own applications.\n",

    "## Setting up a SQLite database in Flask\n",
    "Flask is a popular Python web framework that enables developers to build web applications easily and quickly. Flask is classified as a micro-framework because it provides only the essential tools and features needed for building web applications.\n",
    "One of the key features of Flask is its ability to work seamlessly with databases, including SQLite. A database is a collection of data stored in an organized manner that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.\n",
    "Flask makes it easy to create a web application that interacts with a SQLite database by providing several built-in tools and extensions. Flask's database integration capabilities allow developers to create applications that can perform complex data manipulation and retrieval operations, such as searching, filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.\n",
    "In order to set up a SQLite database in Flask, we need to import the necessary libraries and tools, create a Flask application, connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3, create a cursor object to execute SQL commands, and create tables in the database using SQL commands.\n",
    "Flask provides several extensions and tools for working with SQLite databases, including Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-SQLite3, and Flask-Admin. These tools provide a high-level interface for interacting with the database, making it easy to perform common operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records.\n",

It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. Within a try block, the cursor.execute() method is called with an SQL INSERT command to insert a new record into the 'professors' table, using placeholders to prevent SQL injection attacks. The connection.commit() method saves the changes to the database, and if the record is inserted successfully, a confirmation message is printed. In case of errors, the except block catches the sqlite3.Error exception and prints an error message. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the create() function is called to execute the code, showcasing a practical way to store user-inputted data in a SQLite database. This create function can be easily adapted to other projects where it is necessary to store user-inputted data."
