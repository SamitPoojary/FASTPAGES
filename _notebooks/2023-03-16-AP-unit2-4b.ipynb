    "**A database schema is a blueprint or a logical representation of the entire database.

It is often used as a primary key or as a surrogate key to uniquely identify each row in the table. The values of an identity column are generated automatically by the database management system (DBMS), typically using a sequence or an auto-incrementing integer.**\n",
    "- What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?\n",
    "**In SQL databases, a primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity by ensuring that no two rows in the table have the same values for the primary key. The primary key is also used to create relationships between tables, such as foreign key constraints.**\n",

    "- What is a connection object?  After you google it, what do you think it does?\n",
    "    - an object that represents a connection to a database. After searching, I found that it is a Python object that is returned by a database driver when a connection to the database is established. It is used to execute queries and commands against the database, and also provides access to transaction management and other features.\n",
    "- Same for cursor object?\n",
    "    - an object used to interact with a database by executing SQL queries and fetching the results. After searching, I found that it is created from a connection object and is used to execute SQL statements against the database. It provides methods to fetch results, iterate over result sets, and access metadata about the query.\n",
    "- Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger.  What attributes are in the object?\n",
    "    - The attributes of a connection object and a cursor object can vary depending on the specific database and driver being used. In general, however, a connection object may have attributes such as the connection string, the database name, the server hostname and port, the username and password used to authenticate, and the transaction isolation level. A cursor object may have attributes such as the SQL statement being executed, the number of rows affected by the last operation, and the result set being returned.\n",
    "- Is \"results\" an object?  How do you know?\n",
    "    - \"results\" is likely not an object itself, but rather a variable or data structure that contains the results of a query executed using a cursor object. Depending on the specific database and driver being used, the results may be returned as a list of tuples, a pandas DataFrame, or some other data structure. To know for sure, we would need to inspect the code or documentation that defines the \"results\" variable."

    "- Explain try/except, when would except occur?\n",
    "    - try/except is a control flow structure used in Python to handle exceptions that may occur during program execution. The try block contains code that may raise an exception, while the except block contains code that will be executed if an exception is raised. The purpose of using try/except is to provide a way to gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing or exiting unexpectedly. The except block will occur when an exception is raised within the try block.\n",
    "- What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated?\n",
    "    - It appears that the code repeated in each of these examples is the conn.cursor() method call. This is because a cursor object is required in order to execute SQL queries against the database. By creating a new cursor object for each query, the code is able to execute multiple queries against the database without overwriting the results of previous queries. Additionally, creating a new cursor object can help ensure that each query is executed in a new transaction, which can be useful for maintaining consistency and isolation in the data."
