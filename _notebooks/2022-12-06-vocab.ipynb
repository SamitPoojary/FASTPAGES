    "<strong>Bytes</strong>: A byte is a unit of data that is eight bits long. It is used by computers to represent a character such as a letter or number symbol. \n",

    "<strong>Hexadecimal</strong>: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. There are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters -- A, B, C, D, E and F. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits.\n",

Unicode is a new standard defining an association between characters and even more numbers. Each unicode character (utf8) is 4 bytes, or 32 bits, enough for 2^32 different characters. Most modern programming languages represent strings as utf8 encoded characters (hex) because people use these new symbols in their code, but old languages like C still associat either character type with a single byte integer\n",
