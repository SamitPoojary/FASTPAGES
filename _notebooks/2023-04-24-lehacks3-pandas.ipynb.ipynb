    "Predictive analysis is the use of **statistical algorithms**, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future events or behaviors. It involves identifying **patterns** and trends in data, and then using that information to forecast what is likely to happen in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analysis is used in a wide range of applications, from forecasting sales and demand, to predicting customer behavior, to detecting fraudulent transactions. It involves collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including historical data, customer data, financial data, and social media data, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of predictive analysis typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Defining the problem and identifying the relevant data sources\n",
    "2. **Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent**\n",
    "3. Exploring and analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends\n",
    "4. Selecting an appropriate model or algorithm to use for predictions\n",
    "5. Training and validating the model using historical data\n",
    "6. **Using the trained model to make predictions on new data and refining the model as necessary based on the results.**\n",
    "7. Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the model over time\n",

    "Predictive analysis can help organizations make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage by leveraging insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is most commonly used in **marketing**, where workers try to predict which products would be most popular and try to advertise those products as much as possible, and also **healthcare**, where algorithms analyze patterns and reveal prerequisites for diseases and suggest preventive treatment, predict the results of various treatments and choose the best option for each patient individually, and predict disease outbreaks and epidemics."

One of the most common tasks in data analysis is finding the **mean**, **median**, and **mode** of a dataset. Numpy provides functions to perform these operations quickly and easily.

The standard deviation function calculates how spread out the data is from the mean. Additionally, numpy provides functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the data. These functions are very useful for gaining insight into the properties of large datasets and can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks."

    "Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories. Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Also it is a part of data analysis, and data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Can Pandas Do?\n",
    "Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:\n",
    "- Is there a correlation between two or more columns?\n",
    "- What is average value\n",
    "- Max value\n",
    "- Min value\n",
    "- How to load data \n",
    "- Delete data \n",
    "- Sort Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data."
