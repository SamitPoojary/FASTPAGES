    "- binary is ones and zeros\n",
    "- computers use binary to convert data, messages, etc\n",
    "- binary search is a faster way to search for items in a list. follows a log(n) pattern\n",
    "- I can convert decimal to binary and vice versa\n",
    "- binary is used in networking and sub-netting\n",
    "\n",
    "> Binary is can be applied in many ways to store, access, and manipulate information. Think of three applications that rely on binary.\n",
    "- networking and sub-netting\n",
    "- encryption\n",
    "- computers could use it to store and convert data securely and efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why is binary such an effective system for storing information? Why don't computers use the decimal system instead?\n",
    "- Binary is an effective system for storing information in computers because it is a two-digit system that can represent all numbers and characters using only two digits: 0 and 1. \n",
    "- This simplicity of the binary system makes it easy for computers to use and process information quickly and accurately."

The results are stored in separate variables as decimal numbers. Then, the bin() function is used to convert each decimal result to binary, and the binary strings are stored in separate variables. Finally, the program returns a tuple of tuples, with each inner tuple containing both the decimal and binary result for each operation. The outer tuple is unpacked into separate variables for printing, and the results are displayed as both decimal and binary."
