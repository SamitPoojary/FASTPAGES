While showcasing our project to the rest of the CSP and CSA students (along with some curious parents!), we had many positive reactions and feedback Many students found it interesting Even more greatly appreciated the ability to choose an interface with their preferred language Here’s our project on display: Above is the CodeHoots project, which is a project that rivals Kahoot. Each question prompted the user with a timer and a skip question button, and the frontend was layed out perfectly Probably my favorite project out of the whole CS group Very well made and usable Above is a Casino-based project, which consists of multiple video games and interactions I personally enjoyed their blackjack game, but the other games were also fun I thought it was super impressive that they had a co-op version for Pong]]></summary></entry></feed>
