As you can see, I earned a 47/50 on the MCQ.</p>

<h1 id="corrections-and-reflection">Corrections and Reflection</h1>

<p>Question 27:
<img src="/FASTPAGES/images/tri2_midterm_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I had chosen option C.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This algorithm is wrong, however. This is because the function get messed up since the n = n+1 is set at the beginning, therefore, the “repeat n times” function will mess the code up from the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, option D is correct because it sets the n = n+1 at the end of the algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 28:
<img src="/FASTPAGES/images/tri2_midterm_3.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here I had chosen the correct options in A and C, but I must have been rushing, as I had also chosen option B. This resulted in me choosing 3 different options even though the instructions clearly intructed for just 2 to be selected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 30:
<img src="/FASTPAGES/images/tri2_midterm_4.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here I had chosen option C, which is correct, but I had chosen option A instead of B. B is the correct algorithm out of the two, however, because the “drawCircle” command comes after setting the new r and y values.</p>
