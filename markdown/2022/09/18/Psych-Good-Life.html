    <h3 id="main-takeaway-from-video">Main Takeaway From Video!:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students have constantly been dealing with stress, so much to the point where they aren’t able to enjoy life as much as they should.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goal">Goal:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the root causes of stress amongst High School students partaking AP courses</li>
  <li>Understand if the people around you can make a difference on one’s stress levels.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="as-a-group-our-scrum-team-was-able-to-put-together-a-short-6-question-mental-health-assessment-to-get-a-better-idea-of-what-causes-stress-and-anxiety-as-well-as-what-can-possible-aidharm-it">As a group, our Scrum Team was able to put together a short, 6 question mental health assessment to get a better idea of what causes stress and anxiety, as well as what can possible aid/harm it.</h4>

<h4 id="after-sending-the-form-out-to-a-variety-of-students-from-all-over-pusd-our-group-analyzed-the-first-30-responses-of-the-form">After sending the form out to a variety of students from all over PUSD, our group analyzed the first 30 responses of the form.</h4>

<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/stressq1.png" alt="" title="Question 1" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>This first question first interprets the typical levels of stress honors high school students face throughout a typical school year</li>
  <li>Clearly, out of the thirty responses, nearly 90% agreed on either a rating of 4 or 5 (extreme or overwhelming, respectively)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/stressq2.png" alt="" title="Question 2" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>This question then interprets the root cause of that stress</li>
  <li>Out of the 30 students, nearly 85% of them agreed that school inflicted the most amount of stress</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/stressq3.png" alt="" title="Question 3" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>This third question reflects how bad the states of mind some students resorted to</li>
  <li>Clearly, the stress levels took a large toll on them, for 60% of these students endured difficult periods of time</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/stressq4.png" alt="" title="Question 4" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Resulting from stress and anxiety, students may lose sleep, and may not be able to productively and efficiently grow.</li>
  <li>It seems that the average honors high school student is able to muster a solid 7-8 hours of sleep, which is around the recommended amount for adolescents.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/stressq5.png" alt="" title="Question 5" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>This question pertains to whether or not these students are socially interactive with other students at their school, or with members at home.</li>
  <li>Clearly, a majority of students are happy with whom they hang out with, but there is still a quarter percentage of students who dislike the social environment they are surrounded by</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/stressq6.png" alt="" title="Question 6" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>This final question concludes the assessment, and derives the final answer behind what could potentially stimulate, or greatly lessen the amounts of stress students are forced to deal with.</li>
  <li>Clearly, a healthier social circle reduces the total amount of stress a student must deal with, whereas a unhealthy social circle leads to even more anxiety.</li>
</ul>

By doing so, they are increasing their chances of experiencing reduced amount of stress and anxiety, which is what ALL high school students strive for.</h3>
