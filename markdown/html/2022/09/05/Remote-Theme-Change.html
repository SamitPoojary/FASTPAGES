</ul><p>For kicks, I decided to change the deafult minima theme to a different variant - just to see the possible drawbacks of doing so.</p>

<p>After finding it online, I was able to change the entire theme of my FastPages site to darkmode, which was done by importing it into custom-styles.scss section of my minima section.

<p>Once the changes had been committed, here were the results:

<p>I also tried to change the jekyll style, but it didn’t even allow me to commit for some reason…

<p>As shown above, the darkmode theme makes my blog site look really cool! The black contrasts super well with my title image of Kobe Bryant, and I was really looking forward to keeping the theme.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the jekyll theme had some strange effects on my coding syntax, and even prohibited my ability to access my Tags page! I was extremely upset that this awesome theme took so much away from the backbone of my blog site, but it’s all part of the process.</p>

<p>I was soon able to figure out that the jekyll theme which I had found online wasn’t compatible with the corresponding CSS of my FastPages site, so I searched up one that WAS compatible, and now it actually allows me to commit, but doesn’t permit my ability to actually navigate my site!</p>

<p>I prefer to have my Tagging and Search features to be WORKING, since it just makes finding specific notebooks/posts so much easier.</p>
