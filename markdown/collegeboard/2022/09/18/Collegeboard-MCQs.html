  <li>Effective collaboration is able to produce computing innovations that reflect the diversity of skillful talents and varying perspectives of those who designed it.</li>
  <li>A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function</li>
  <li>Computing innovations can be physical (such as a self-driving car), or nonphysical, such as softwares or concepts (picture editing software, e-commerce, etc.)</li>
  <li>Communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation are all interpersonal skills leraned through collaboration.</li>
  <li>Don’t be a backseat programmer! It is important to note the difference between back-seat programming and navigating.</li>
  <li>Let the driver work through things, but help them out whenever they require assistance! Everyone makes mistakes, so it’s understandable.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>

  <li>Although we are constructed based off of close friend relationships, we work extremely well together, constantly learning from one another and progressing forward as a collective group.</li>
  <li>Our group in particular is diverse in terms of ethnic background and perspectives, but not gender. I feel that we will still be successful as a team, as long as we stay true to working together.</li>
</ul>
