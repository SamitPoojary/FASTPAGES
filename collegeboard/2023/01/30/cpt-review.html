      <td>Shows how data has been stored in a collection and shows data from that collection as it contributes to the overall purpose of the program. Identifies the name of a variable representing the collection being used and describes what the data contained in the collection represents in the program.</td>
      <td>Our program abstracts data through data implementation which is accessed in a backend database. The purpose of this database is to store information about a user - be it their inventory, details, and stock - and these values should be able to be used in our program and construct a usable application where users can store and view details and inputs</td>

<h2 id="cpt">CPT</h2>

<p>Each team member will be programming a special feature for the management system, so the individual create performance tasks will be focused on the respective features. For the n@tm project, we plan on intertwining each feature together to build one large application.</p>

<h2 id="coding-my-feature">Coding my Feature</h2>

<p>Using SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python…</p>

<ol>
  <li>User should be able to input inventory to keep track of their detailed product in a table</li>
  <li>They should be prompted with a button to click on</li>
  <li>Once clicked, the button should navigate the user to the attributes of the inventory, including things such as the data of input, user name, name of item, and quantity.</li>
  <li>User should then be able to click another button that adds all this into a neat table for the user to view and refer back to whenever needed</li>
  <li>A “delete item” button will be implemented to allow the user to get rid of the item if needed, and an “edit item” will also be implemented so that the user can make changes on the go.</li>
</ol>

<p>Video Ideation:</p>

<p>I plan to show each aspect of the feature. The first is inputting an item into the table, with specified attributes. The next is editing the item once it has already been in display in the neat table, and finally, the delete item feature.</p>
