<h2 id="questions-i-missed">Questions I missed</h2>
<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/tri1mcq1.png" alt="" title="Question 35" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>I had originally chosen option B and D, but A and D was the correct pairing</li>
  <li>This is because choice A sets the maxPS to 50 by default, so the IF statment sets the maxPS to 30 whenever time &gt; 120.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/tri1mcq2.png" alt="" title="Question 42" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since num1 &lt; num2 evaluates to false, the body of the ELSE block is executed and num3 is assigned the value 4. Since num2 ≥ num3 evaluates to true, the body of the second IF block is executed and num1 is assigned the value 8. L</li>
  <li>And, obviously, the sum of 8+4+4 equates to 16.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/FASTPAGES/images/tri1mcq3.png" alt="" title="Question 43" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Choice C is correct in this case because the variables “x” and “result” are intialized to 0. Inside the loop, result is increased by “x” and “x” is increased by 1. The loop terminates when “x” exceeds 5.</li>
  <li>Therefore, “result” is assigned the sum of the integers from 0 to 5, or 15; not 14.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="strengths-and-weaknesses">Strengths and Weaknesses:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I had a difficult time coping with questions regarding binary, and often found myself using online help for those questions</li>
  <li>However, I did note that I did well on questions regarding collaboration and team activity, and particularly on the questions asking what the line of code would do.</li>
</ul>
