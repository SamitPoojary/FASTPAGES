<ul>
  <li>While showcasing our project to the rest of the CSP and CSA students (along with some curious parents!), we had many positive reactions and feedback</li>
  <li>Many students found it interesting</li>
  <li>Even more greatly appreciated the ability to choose an interface with their preferred language</li>
  <li>Here’s our project on display:

<img src="/FASTPAGES/images/gr1.png" alt="" title="CodeHoots" /></li>
  <li>Above is the CodeHoots project, which is a project that rivals Kahoot.</li>
  <li>Each question prompted the user with a timer and a skip question button, and the frontend was layed out perfectly</li>
  <li>Probably my favorite project out of the whole CS group</li>
  <li>Very well made and usable
<img src="/FASTPAGES/images/gr2.png" alt="" title="Casino" /></li>
  <li>Above is a Casino-based project, which consists of multiple video games and interactions</li>
  <li>I personally enjoyed their blackjack game, but the other games were also fun</li>
  <li>I thought it was super impressive that they had a co-op version for Pong</li>
</ul>
